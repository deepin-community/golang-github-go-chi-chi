Description: lightweight, idiomatic and composable router for building Go HTTP services
 This package contains a lightweight, idiomatic and composable router
 for building Go HTTP services. It's especially good at helping you
 write large REST API services that are kept maintainable as your
 project grows and changes. chi is built on the new context package
 introduced in Go 1.7 to handle signaling, cancellation and
 request-scoped values across a handler chain.
 .
 The focus of the project has been to seek out an elegant and comfortable
 design for writing REST API servers.
